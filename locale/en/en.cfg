[mod-setting-description]
bismuth-disable-pcb-solder=Remove pcb solder from recipes. Not sure why you would remove it tho xD 
bismuth-contain-bismuth=How much of one ore (10000) contains bismuth. Reccomended to not change for more realism.
bismuth-contain-sulfur=How much of one ore (10000) contains sulfur. Reccomended to not change for more realism.
